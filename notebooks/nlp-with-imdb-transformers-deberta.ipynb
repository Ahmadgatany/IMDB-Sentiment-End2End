    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformers have revolutionized the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP).  \n",
    "Unlike traditional models that process text sequentially (like RNNs and LSTMs), transformers use **self-attention mechanisms** to capture relationships between words — regardless of their position in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows transformer models to:\n",
    "- Understand context more effectively\n",
    "- Process text in parallel (faster training)\n",
    "- Achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of NLP tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "Among these models, **DeBERTa (Decoding-enhanced BERT with Disentangled Attention)** stands out as an advanced architecture that improves upon BERT and RoBERTa by enhancing attention mechanisms and word embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we apply **DeBERTa-v3-small** to the **IMDB movie reviews dataset**, performing binary sentiment classification (**positive** or **negative**).  \n",
    "Unlike classical pipelines where we handle tokenization and embedding manually, transformers like DeBERTa handle these internally — making the workflow cleaner and more powerful.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is part of a broader NLP project:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 📘 [**NLP with IMDB: Classic Models (TF-IDF + BiLSTM)**](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ahmedgaitani/nlp-with-imdb-classic-models-tf-idf-bilstm): focused on traditional approaches\n",
    "- 🤖 **This notebook**: focuses on fine-tuning a modern transformer (DeBERTa)\n",
    "- 📊 **Next notebook**: will compare all models side by side using a range of evaluation metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, we will have:\n",
    "- Fine-tuned a transformer model on IMDB reviews\n",
    "- Generated predictions on the test set\n",
    "- Saved results for later comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s get started!\n"

    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Step 1: Load Tokenizer and Model\n",
    "We load the **DeBERTa tokenizer** and **pre-trained model** using the model name `\"microsoft/deberta-v3-small\"`.  \n",
    "This model has been trained on a large corpus and is capable of understanding rich language representations.  \n",
    "We specify `num_labels=2` since our task is binary classification: **positive** vs. **negative** sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Step 2: Convert to Hugging Face Datasets\n",
    "We convert our `train_df` and `val_df` from pandas DataFrames to `datasets.Dataset` format.  \n",

    "We tokenize the review texts using the `tokenizer`, applying:\n",
    "- **Truncation** to cut long reviews (limit = 512 tokens)\n",
    "- **Padding** to make all sequences equal length (for batching)\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike classical NLP pipelines where we manually build features (TF-IDF, Word2Vec),  \n",
    "transformer models like DeBERTa **learn contextual embeddings** during fine-tuning — no need for separate embedding steps.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Step 5: Define Evaluation Metric\n",

    "- Gets logits from model output\n",
    "- Applies `argmax` to get predicted labels\n",

    "- `batch_size`, `learning_rate`, `epochs`, `weight_decay`\n",
    "- Saving best model based on validation accuracy\n",
    "- Enabling `fp16` (mixed precision) for faster training on GPU\n",
